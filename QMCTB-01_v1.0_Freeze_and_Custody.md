# QMCTB-01 v1.0  
## Protocol Freeze and Custodial Declaration

**Authoritative archive (Zenodo DOI):**  
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18075090

**Status:** Frozen | Stable | Citable

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document formally declares **QMCTB-01** frozen at version **v1.0**.  
It defines the authoritative scope, execution boundary, and custodial rules governing the benchmark.

In the event of any conflict, this document supersedes all explanatory materials, repositories, manuscripts, figures, and derivative descriptions.

---

## 2. Benchmark Identity

- **Benchmark Name:** QMCTB-01  
- **Expansion:** Quantum Measurement Causality Test Bench  
- **Version:** v1.0  
- **Status:** Frozen  
- **Intended Use:** Detector-plane measurement benchmarking in hybrid quantum–classical systems

---

## 3. Scope (Immutable)

QMCTB-01 defines a benchmark for:

- Localizing irreversible transformations at the **detector plane**
- Evaluating measurement causality across detector material, front-end electronics, digitization, firmware, and software readout
- Producing instrumentation-level diagnostics of coherence preservation or loss

QMCTB-01 explicitly excludes:

- Quantum interpretations
- Observer models
- Ontological claims
- Post-measurement metaphysics
- Hardware prescriptions or vendor-specific requirements

Any use or extension beyond this scope is **non-compliant** with QMCTB-01.

---

## 4. Execution Boundary

The benchmark boundary is fixed at the **detector plane**, defined as the complete measurement pipeline from physical signal imprint through classical data record generation.

Processes above this boundary, including human observation, statistical storytelling, and interpretive analysis, are outside the benchmark’s authority.

---

## 5. Definitions

All terminology used in QMCTB-01 is frozen as defined in:

- `DEFINITION.md`
- The QMCTB-01 manuscript text
- The Zenodo archival record

No alternative or extended definitions are permitted under QMCTB-01 v1.0.

---

## 6. Outputs and Claims

Permitted benchmark outputs include:

- Detector-induced correlation degradation
- Timing, latency, and jitter signatures
- Coherence survival indicators
- Measurement distortion metrics attributable to detector-plane processes

QMCTB-01 does **not** permit claims regarding:

- Wavefunction collapse
- Physical reality or observation
- Interpretations of quantum mechanics

---

## 7. Versioning and Change Control

- QMCTB-01 v1.0 permits **errata only** for typographical correction or clarification
- No semantic expansion or scope modification is allowed
- Any extension requires a new benchmark identifier (e.g., QMCTB-02)

---

## 8. Custodianship

- **Protocol Author and Custodian:** Srikar R  
- Custodianship for QMCTB-01 v1.0 remains fixed
- Future benchmarks may evolve independently, provided QMCTB-01 is cited unchanged and without reinterpretation

---

## 9. Archival Authority

- The Zenodo DOI is the canonical archival reference
- The GitHub repository serves as an execution reference
- The manuscript provides explanatory context only

In the event of discrepancy, this freeze document is authoritative.

---

## 10. Validity

QMCTB-01 v1.0 remains valid until explicitly superseded or deprecated by public custodial notice.
