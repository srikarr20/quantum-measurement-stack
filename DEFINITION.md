# Definition of the Quantum Measurement Stack

This document provides the formal definition and governing rules of the
Quantum Measurement Stack (QMS). It is intended to be read before any
layer-specific documentation.

The definitions in this file are normative. Layer READMEs specify behavior;
this document specifies structure and constraints.

## Formal Definition

The Quantum Measurement Stack is a **strictly ordered causal decomposition** of
a quantum experiment from physical state formation to system-level control.

Each layer represents a **distinct physical or operational process** with a
well-defined input and output. Transitions between layers are **irreversible**:
information lost at a given layer is not accessible to any higher layer.

The stack is not a conceptual hierarchy, taxonomy, or abstraction model.
It is a **measurement pipeline** whose ordering reflects physical causality and
engineering constraints.

---

## Scope and Intent

The purpose of this decomposition is to ensure that claims about coherence,
interference, decoherence, or entanglement are traceable to **specific physical
or operational stages**, rather than being conflated across:

- physical dynamics,
- detector coupling,
- data acquisition,
- statistical inference,
- system control.

The stack does not introduce new quantum mechanics. It provides a framework
for organizing, diagnosing, and controlling quantum experiments with clear
causal boundaries.

## Governing Rules

The Quantum Measurement Stack enforces the following rules:

1. Each layer operates only on the output of the layer immediately below it.
2. Each layer introduces irreversible information loss.
3. No layer may assume access to information destroyed at a lower layer.
4. Statistical inference and system control are strictly separated.
5. Feedback is permitted only at the top layer and applies only to future runs.
6. Post-processing cannot substitute for measurement or acquisition fidelity.

Violations of these rules result in category errors, not recoverable artifacts.

## Relationship to Layer Documentation

Layer-specific READMEs define:
- responsibilities,
- boundaries,
- inputs and outputs,
- failure modes.

They must be interpreted in accordance with the constraints defined here.

This document is authoritative with respect to stack ordering, causality,
and irreversibility.
